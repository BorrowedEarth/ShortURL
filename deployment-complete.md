## 🌐 Your ShortURL Service is Live!

### Current Access URLs:
- **HTTP**: http://68.183.57.115
- **HTTPS**: https://68.183.57.115 (with self-signed cert - browser will show warning)
- **Health Check**: https://68.183.57.115/healthz

### Test Short URLs:
- https://68.183.57.115/4526 (redirects to EL Education resources)
- https://68.183.57.115/4525 (redirects to EL Education resources)
- All 3,626 URLs from your CSV are working!

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Update DNS Settings (Required for eled.org)
Currently `eled.org` points to `107.21.117.177`, but needs to point to `68.183.57.115`:

**In your domain registrar, update:**
- `eled.org` A record → `68.183.57.115`
- `www.eled.org` A record → `68.183.57.115`

### 2. Get Real SSL Certificate (After DNS Update)
Once DNS is updated, run this command on the server:
```bash
# Update the email in the script first
nano /root/get-letsencrypt-ssl.sh
# Then run it
/root/get-letsencrypt-ssl.sh
```

This will:
- Get a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate
- Automatically configure nginx for HTTPS
- Remove browser security warnings

### 3. Final Testing Checklist
After DNS propagation (24-48 hours):
- [ ] https://eled.org loads the ShortURL interface
- [ ] https://eled.org/4526 redirects correctly
- [ ] SSL certificate shows as valid (no browser warnings)
- [ ] All existing short URLs work with the new domain
